# Project Summary: Legal Document AI Analyzer

Here's a summary of what we've achieved so far in setting up your full-stack Legal Document AI Analyzer:

### 1. Backend Setup (FastAPI):
1.  We've successfully established a robust **FastAPI backend** to handle legal document analysis.
2.  The `main.py` file has been configured with essential imports for FastAPI, Pydantic, OS interactions, logging, `google.generativeai` (for LLM integration), `json`, `PyPDF2`, and `docx` for document processing.
3.  Logging is configured to help monitor the application's activity.
4.  The backend incorporates configuration for your Large Language Model (LLM) API key and uses `gemini-1.5-flash` as the model.
5.  Pydantic models (`DocumentText`, `RiskAnalysisResult`, `DetailedAnalysisResult`) are defined to ensure structured data for requests and responses, accommodating various analysis outputs.
6.  A helper function (`generate_llm_response`) is included for seamless interaction with the LLM, ensuring JSON output.
7.  Two main API endpoints are implemented:
    * `/analyze-document-text`: For analyzing pasted text using different prompt types (e.g., risk identification, detailed analysis).
    * `/upload-and-analyze`: For extracting text from and analyzing uploaded PDF or DOCX files.
8.  The backend is confirmed to be running successfully on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
9.  Your Python virtual environment (`BackVenv`) is correctly set up and manages Python dependencies.

### 2. Frontend (React with Vite) Setup:
1.  We've established a modern **React frontend** using Vite, ensuring a fast development experience.
2.  The `Frontend/src/App.jsx` file has been updated to serve as the main application component, featuring a user interface with:
    * A text input area for pasting documents.
    * A dropdown to select various analysis prompt types.
    * Buttons to trigger text analysis or file uploads.
    * A file input for uploading PDF or DOCX documents.
    * Dynamic display areas for analysis results, loading indicators, and error messages.
    * Integration with `axios` for making HTTP requests to your FastAPI backend.
3.  The `Frontend/src/App.css` file has been updated to provide a clean and modern styling for the application.
4.  Necessary Node.js packages, including `axios`, have been installed within your `Frontend/node_modules/` directory.
5.  Your frontend is now confirmed to be running and accessible, typically at `http://localhost:5173/`.

### 3. Git Configuration:
1.  A comprehensive `.gitignore` file has been created/updated at the root of your project. This file is configured to:
    * Ignore Python virtual environments and bytecode files (`venv/`, `BackVenv/`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`).
    * Ignore common editor/IDE specific files and OS files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `.DS_Store`).
    * Crucially, ignore Node.js dependencies (`node_modules/`) and frontend build artifacts (`dist/`, `.vite/`).
2.  It was clarified that essential frontend files (like `App.jsx`, `index.html`, `package.json`, `src/`) are meant to be tracked and committed, not ignored.

### Overall Achievement:
You now have a **fully operational full-stack web application** where your React frontend communicates with your FastAPI backend to perform AI-powered legal document analysis, complete with proper environment and version control setup!
