üé® PixelPalettes: Legal Document Risk Analysis ‚öñÔ∏è
üè® Team: Hotel California
‚ú® Project Overview
Our team, Hotel California, understands "Pixel Palettes" as the exciting intersection of creativity and technology. This theme has inspired us to express complex ideas through visual and generative art, providing a unique lens through which to approach challenging problems. We interpret the "Pixel Palettes" theme as an incredible opportunity to transform traditionally dense and inaccessible information ‚Äì specifically legal documents ‚Äì into visually intuitive formats using a pixel-inspired design.

‚ùì The Problem We're Solving: Legal Document Risk Analysis
Legal policies, bills, and political drafts are frequently crafted with vague, biased, or overly complex language. This often leads to confusion or misinterpretation among everyday readers, causing critical risks or hidden implications to go unnoticed. Our primary goal is to demystify this "legalese" and clearly highlight potential hidden risks, thereby making crucial legal information more accessible and transparent to the general public.

üí° Our Solution: Leveraging AI for Visual Storytelling
To achieve our objectives, we are leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). These advanced AI models will be employed with a specialized focus on identifying inter-clause dependencies. This unique capability allows our system to not only detect individual red-flag clauses but also to spot compounding risks that emerge when multiple clauses interact within a document.

Beyond this, our LLMs will also be responsible for:

üìù Accurately summarizing lengthy legal sections.

üó£Ô∏è Converting complex legal jargon into plain, understandable language.

These rich insights generated by the AI are then seamlessly mapped onto a color-coded pixel grid. In this visual representation, each "pixel" intuitively represents the risk level associated with a specific clause or section of the document. This approach effectively combines the analytical power of artificial intelligence with the clarity and immediate impact of visual storytelling, making legal risk understandable at a glance.
